### Bumjin Kim (3 Browse screens (Rise together, Your Peaks, Run a marathon) which are the bottom last three screens of wireframe and I connected and linked them together (Button clicks, menu options, navigation). Floating button is implemented but its transition will be done in next sprint when I make Create Your Own Peak screen for next sprint. Menu options are added in the navigation bar to navigate to other screens. "Search for a plan" function will be implemented in next sprint.)
