# Ascend
  Part of life is continuously growing, learning and trying new things. Everyone I know has a few things that they want to improve at; whether it getting better grades, learning how to play the saxophone, hiking K2, or any other fulfilling endeavor. Pushing yourself to achieve a goal can be one of the most rewarding, meaningful journeys life has to offer. However, as I seem to find out every New Year, imagining a better you is one thing, actually having the discipline, dedication and determination to go through the pain and suffering that getting better demands is another thing altogether. One tried and true method that makes this process of long term improvement doable is making measurable goals and specific plans to help achieve these goals. All achievers, from people who ace the MCAT to elite athletes, set goals and make training programs pertinent to those goals. Usually, no matter what the goal actually is, people have very similar needs and wants when making these plans. They need to be able to visualize their plan, they want to be able to imagine themselves achieving, they need to be able to see how their plan stacks up against the rest of their daily schedule. That is where Ascend comes in. Ascend is a motivational, productivity app that lets users easily and effectively make goal oriented plans and helps them achieve these goals.  Ascend will allow users to schedule daily tasks that contribute to their goals and positively reinforce users to actually complete these tasks. Furthermore, Ascend will contain a database of users plans, so that people can see and copy other peoples plans as a starting point. Finally, users will also be able to easily track their progress and see themselves get closer to their goal.
