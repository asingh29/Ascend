# Ascend
  Part of what it means to be human is striving to be the best version of ourselves. We all have goals, dreams and ambitions floating around in the back of our mind; things we wish we had the time, motivation and energy for but that never seem to quite come to fruition. I mean its only March, and I dont even remember what my New Years resolution was. But it doesnt have to be this way. One of the most effective techniques that we can use to actually achieve our ambitions is to create specific, detailed plans. Think about the way professional athletes plan their workouts, or the way businesses plan their design process, or even the way you planned how to study for your last midterm. That is where Ascend comes in. Ascend is a motivational productivity app that allows users to easily create, keep track of and achieve goal oriented plans. Ascend pushes users to achieve new heights, making it easier for users to track their progress and stick to their goals. It also gives users a huge head start, by letting them publish and view the plans of people with similar dreams. And most of all, Ascend empowers users to conquer their mountain.
